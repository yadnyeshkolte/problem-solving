## Problem Description

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **Least Recently Used (LRU) cache**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

## Approach

We can combine a Hash Map (for `O(1)` lookups) and a Doubly Linked List (for `O(1)` removals and additions). 
- Node class to hold key, value, prev, next
- Head and Tail dummy nodes in the Doubly Linked List to ease boundary operations.

## Solution

```java
// Add your implementation here...
class LRUCache {

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        
    }
    
    public int get(int key) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        
    }
}
```
